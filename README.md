# Wallify
Sets your desktop wallpaper to your current spotify album cover
Requires PIL, omelette, requests, six and spotipy packages, as listed in the requirements.txt
Note: I manually added an updated version of the spotipy package created by Paul Lamere at https://github.com/plamere.
This is because installing it through PIP consistently gives an outdated version.

Simply run the program wallify.exe if using the executable version, otherwise run WallifyEx.py and proceed through the instructions shown
on the console. Remember to use Ctrl + C to close the console otherwise the program may fail to return your old wallpaper upon ending.
